# Benefits Assistant Demo - Product Requirements Document

## Based on Melodie's Exact Requirements with Supporting Quotes

## Executive Summary

**Quote from Job Posting:** *"We are looking for an experienced chatbot developer to build a custom GPT-4-powered chatbot for an organization that provides benefits information to its users. The chatbot will assist end-users in understanding their benefits plans by providing accurate and user-friendly answers. This project will serve as a template framework for future chatbot implementations, so it must be scalable and well-documented."*

**Why This Matters:** This establishes the core requirement for a GPT-4 chatbot specifically for benefits guidance that must be designed as a scalable template.

This document outlines development of a benefits advisor demonstration that meets Melodie's specific technical requirements while building on the existing Vercel AI chatbot template foundation.

## Technical Requirements (Direct from Job Posting)

### Core Integration Requirements

**Quote:** *"Configure Azure Cognitive Search to index benefits data (FAQs, plan summaries, etc.). Integrate GPT-4 API to power conversational AI."*

**Why This Matters:** Azure Cognitive Search is a hard requirement, not optional. Must be integrated alongside GPT-4.

**Quote:** *"A fully functional chatbot integrated with GPT-4 and Azure Cognitive Search."*

**Implementation Strategy:** Extend the existing Vercel AI chatbot template by adding Azure Cognitive Search for benefits document retrieval while maintaining the existing chat interface and AI capabilities.

### Scalability Requirements from Melodie

**Quote from Melodie:** *"Since this chatbot will be customized to one employer's benefits, I'd like to know if you can design the architecture in a way that makes it easy to replicate for other employers in the future. For example, could we leverage the same framework and simply upload new benefits data, tweak branding, or adjust tone for each new client?"*

**Why This Matters:** Multi-tenant white-label architecture is essential for her business model of serving multiple clients.

**Quote from Melodie:** *"if this goes well, I anticipate having repeat work in the future. So I'm hoping to find someone with the capacity to take on future work, possibly at scale. At first it will involve iterations on this first benefits-advisor bot, and later it may expand to a variety of industries and use cases."*

**Implementation Strategy:** Build modular theming system and client configuration management on top of existing Vercel template.

### Ownership and Platform Requirements

**Quote from Melodie:** *"My client plans to own and pay for hosting and API usage directly (e.g., Azure, OpenAI API). Will you be able to guide us through setting up these accounts and ensure the architecture is built in a way that they (or I) retain full ownership and control of the hosting environment?"*

**Why This Matters:** Client must own all infrastructure and API keys. Architecture must support this.

**Quote from Melodie:** *"While Azure Cognitive Search seems like a great fit for this project, I'd like to confirm if your architecture can be adapted to other platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, should the need arise."*

**Implementation Strategy:** Design abstraction layers that allow platform switching while maintaining Azure as primary implementation.

## Technical Architecture

### Foundation: Existing Vercel AI Template

**Repository Analysis Shows:**

- Next.js 15.3.0-canary with App Router
- Vercel AI SDK for AI integration
- Vercel Postgres with Drizzle ORM
- NextAuth authentication
- shadcn/ui components with theming support
- Artifact system for complex content rendering
- Document attachment capabilities

**Implementation Strategy:** Extend this foundation rather than rebuild, adding benefits-specific functionality while preserving all existing capabilities.

### Required Extensions

#### 1. Azure Cognitive Search Integration

**Quote from Spencer's Proposal:** *"By implementing semantic search clustering alongside Azure Cognitive Search, the system will identify knowledge gaps in real-time and suggest proactive content updates. The architecture will utilize a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, combining dense vector embeddings with traditional keyword matching to ensure both semantic understanding and precise factual accuracy."*

**Implementation Details:**

- Azure Cognitive Search client integration
- Benefits document indexing pipeline
- Semantic search capabilities for natural language queries
- Context injection into GPT-4 prompts

#### 2. Benefits-Specific AI Expertise

**Quote from Job Posting:** *"Build conversational flows, intents, and fallback responses using middleware (e.g., Botpress, Dialogflow, Rasa). Ensure the chatbot handles multi-step queries (e.g., plan comparisons, enrollment assistance)."*

**Implementation Details:**

- Benefits-expert system prompts for GPT-4
- Plan comparison and cost calculation tools
- Multi-step conversation handling for enrollment assistance
- Progressive user profile building

#### 3. Multi-Tenant White-Label System

**Quote from Melodie:** *"could we leverage the same framework and simply upload new benefits data, tweak branding, or adjust tone for each new client?"*

**Implementation Details:**

- Client-specific theming system extending existing CSS variables
- Brand configuration management (logos, colors, messaging)
- Tone and personality customization per client
- Benefits data management per client
